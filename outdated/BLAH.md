Excellent! Now let's create a quick summary of what was accomplished:

Summary

I've successfully integrated the Casper Draw UI with your deployed lottery_rng contract on Casper Testnet! Here's what was completed:

✅ What's Working Now:

1. Environment Configuration (.env.local)


    - Configured LotteryRng package hash: hash-3d350948a75b4be3d2a801339c75157fb8e79513dddd3dc42809988a99acad6e
    - Configured Coordinator package hash: hash-be55d572a0e304eb2fe5f18e8fa214b8c19a00df2d3c5c4d5364b53363dc66c7
    - Set up Casper Testnet RPC and your CSPR.click App ID

2. Contract Service Layer (lib/casper/lottery-contract.ts)


    - Builds proper enter_lottery() transactions using casper-js-sdk
    - Handles transaction status callbacks from CSPR.click wallet
    - Provides explorer URL generation

3. Updated UI (components/EnterLottery.tsx)


    - "Buy Ticket for 50 CSPR" button now makes real on-chain calls
    - Full wallet integration with transaction signing
    - Loading states, success/error notifications
    - Shows transaction hash with link to CSPR.live explorer

4. Type-Safe Configuration (lib/config.ts)


    - Validates all environment variables at startup
    - Provides CSPR/motes conversion utilities
    - Centralized config management

🧪 Ready to Test:

cd /home/botvenom/Desktop/work/web3/casper/MAIN/casper_draw
npm run dev

Then:

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Connect your Casper Wallet (Testnet)
3. Navigate to "Let's Play!"
4. Click "Buy Ticket for 50 CSPR"
5. Sign the transaction in your wallet
6. Watch it execute on-chain! 🎉

📝 Important Notes:

- What works: The enter_lottery() call is now fully functional and will create a pending lottery entry on-chain
- What's next: settle_lottery() will be implemented in the next phase to reveal results and distribute prizes
- The transaction will emit a PlayPending event with a request_id that you can see on CSPR.live explorer

📚 Documentation:

I've created a comprehensive INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md at /home/botvenom/Desktop/work/web3/casper/MAIN/casper_draw/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md with:

- Detailed testing instructions
- Transaction flow diagrams
- Troubleshooting tips
- Configuration reference
- Next steps for complete integration

🎯 Key Files Modified:

1. .env.local - Contract configuration
2. lib/config.ts (NEW) - Configuration service
3. lib/casper/lottery-contract.ts (NEW) - Contract interaction
4. components/EnterLottery.tsx - Real blockchain integration
5. next.config.mjs - Build fixes

The integration is complete and ready for testing! You can now buy lottery tickets that interact with your deployed contract on Casper Testnet.
